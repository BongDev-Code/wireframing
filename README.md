# Wireframing
# What is Wireframing?
Wireframing is creating a basic visual guide that represents the skeletal structure of a
website or application. 

# The Importance of wireframing:
The design phase is to lay out content. functionality, and user interactions without the distraction of design elements like colors or fonts. Wireframes help align teams, clarify ideas, and identify usability issues before coding begins.

# Key Elements of Wireframing:
 1. Layout Structure
    Defines the positioning of elements like headers, footers, sidebars, and content areas.
    Example: Ensures that navigation is consistently placed across all screens.
 2. Navigation
    Shows how users move between pages and features.
    Example: Includes menus, links, and tabs that guide the user journey.
 3. Content Placement
    Specifies where content such as text, images, and buttons will appear.
    Example: Helps users quickly locate the call-to-action button.
 4. Functionality
    Indicates interactive components like forms, dropdowns, or sliders.
    Example: Illustrates how a search filter or login form will behave.

# Types of Wireframes:
 1. Low-Fidelity Wireframes
    These are simple, quick sketches or digital outlines that represent a basic layout. Used in early
    brainstorming stages. - No colors, images, or detailed content. - Great for fast iteration and feedback.
 2. High-Fidelity Wireframes
    These are detailed mockups that closely resemble the final design. - Include precise spacing, fonts, and
    even interactive elements. - Useful for stakeholder approvals and development reference.
    
    Therefore the answer is a High-Fedelity wireframe.

# Wireframing Tools
  Several tools are available for creating wireframes. 
  a. Popular ones include: 
  - Figma: A cloud-based collaborative design tool. It allows real-time editing, easy sharing, and prototyping.
  - Sketch
  - Adobe XD Balsamiq

# WHY FIGMA?:
- Intuitive interface
- Team collaboration features
- Integrates with prototyping 
- handoff tools

# Benefits of Wireframing in Software Development:
 1. Clarifies Requirements: Helps stakeholders and developers understand what needs to be built.
 2. Reduces Rework: Identifies issues early, saving time and resources.
 3. Improves Collaboration: Acts as a common language between designers, developers, and clients.
 4. Guides Development: Provides structure and visual references during coding.

# Wireframing in Practice
Scenario: During wireframing for an e-commerce app, designers noticed the checkout button was too
          small and placed far down the page. User testing with wireframes showed that users struggled 
          to find it.
Resolution: The button was moved higher and made more prominent. As a result, the final product saw
            a 20% increase in completed purchases.
Conclusion: Wireframing helped uncover this issue before development, proving its value in creating a
            user-friendly interface.
